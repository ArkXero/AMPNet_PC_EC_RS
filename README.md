Repo for HackTJ 2025 Project: AMPNet (Adavanced Monitoring and Prediction Network ) The description of the project is as follows

(WEBSITE TEMPLATE IS GENERATED BY CLAUDE AI, DEBUGGING, INTEGRATION, AND OVERALL POLISHING DONE MOSTLY BY HAND WITH SOME HELP FROM 
GITHUB COPILOT AI)

Hackathon Theme + Topic: Impact through innovation // Topic :Sustainability

Fundementals of Project:

Power Grid monitoring web app that uses USEIA API to monitor the electricity and power data of multiple cities.

It measures the Current Load, Voltage Stability, Frequency, Grid Efficiency and a variety statistics for power grid usage

It has a few graph and data visualization tools that help the city government and third party consultants analyze the power trends within the grid.

AI/ML Component: AI integration that can interpret this data and present possible solutions and point out grid weakness both short term and long term.

Attemped to use Random Forest Algorithim to creat predictions based on data, but the intensive and time-consuming nature of the task plus 
our inabilit to integrate it led to us dropping it too late to be able to remove it cleanly

Below is a short documentation on how to get started with it!
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
